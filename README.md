Sulfuric Acid Production Simulation using Multithreading in Java

This project simulates the step-by-step chemical production of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) using Java threads and semaphores to represent real-life dependencies and synchronization in a multistage process. Each molecule involved in the reaction (S, O₂, H₂O, SO₂, SO₃, and H₂SO₄) is produced in order, respecting the actual chemical reaction flow. The simulation showcases:

🔁 Thread synchronization with semaphores

⚛️ Realistic chemical reaction order

💡 Object-oriented design with modular thread classes

🧪 A total of 1000 complete H₂SO₄ productions simulated step by step
